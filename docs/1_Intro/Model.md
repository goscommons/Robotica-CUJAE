# Hi Model

This product is under a final development stage, therefore the documentation provided is still incomplete. The goal is to make it easy for people to get **built this cnc plasma cutter for usage** or **order a kit that can be assembled locally**. The content and ``.md`` files eventually will document all the information to use CAD, CAM files, as well as folder structure and more.
