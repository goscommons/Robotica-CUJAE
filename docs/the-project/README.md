# Intro to the project
This project is focused on providing resources, guidance, and training based on our **validated** and **open source design**  cnc table for plasma cutting. The project goes beyond just releasing the source and aims to build  community based knowledge, networks and collaborative partnerships as part of an economic model based on open collaboration. 
- Build partnerships with those interested in using the design for business and local purposes.
- Teach and train others how to use the machine once is fabricated, what opportunities, possibilities and further developments can take place within the community.

## Story
The CNC plasma table was developed to solve specific manufacturing needs at @polemidis farm based in Maine, USA. Manolis has developed a set of tools that he needs to improve his farm, this is why he developed the [grapples project](), and the [firewood processors]().

::: It is a tool made by a farmer for farmers! :::
