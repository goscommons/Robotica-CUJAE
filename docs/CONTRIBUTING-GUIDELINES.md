## 1. Help us to document the design

If you want to learn open design this is the best place to start. If you want to learn or get skilled in a particular area like CAD modeling, CAD Analysis, Hardware Electronics Design, among many others, this is also the right place to start. We have work items, with different levels of complexity.

#### 1.1. Make a request to become a collaborator in the gitlab repository of the machine you are interested in.
Make the request at the specific machine repository.[Find the list of repositories here](https://github.com/goscommons).

#### 1.2 . Find an issue you know you can contribute to and take over!
Go to the project repository, to the issues section, and see what has been posted.

#### 1.3. You have finished your design documentation piece of work. Make a pull request and get feedback from your peers. This is the last step to finally get your work published, ready to be used and improved by others.

> Celebrate and get inspired! Go back to step 1.2 and find a new exciting issue to solve.**

#### 1.4 What can you do if you don't find an issue Ask to the community, propose a new issue towards fulfilling the design documentation  milestones.

### 3.Are you a media person? a blogger? writer? translator? graphic designer? creative developer? Activist? content creator?
