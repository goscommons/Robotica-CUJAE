# Intro to the project
This project is focused on providing resources, guidance and documentation to make use of a validated and open source design of cnc table design to support plasma cutting.
Beyond just providing the source code, the project intends to build also community  services and partnerships for those interested in making use of this technology to start local business within our community network.
## Story
The CNC plasma table was developed to solve specific manufacturing needs at @polemidis farm based in Maine, USA. Manolis has developed a set of tools that he needs to improve his farm, this is why he developed the [grapples project](), and the [firewood processors]().
