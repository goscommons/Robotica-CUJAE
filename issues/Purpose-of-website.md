# Purpose of CNC plasma cutter website
A website where we show the relevant content that addresses the following issues/needs. We can treat these different content chunks as modules.
## The benefit and opportunities of CNC plasma cutting
- We need an intro about the benefits to use an open hardware plasma cutter. It is nice also to have a compelling story about the current prototype at Maine.
## Basic intro to knowledge base that helps people get started in this topic
- This is talking mostly about the basic principles of plasma cutting. We can also point to videos, references, etc. Should be a simple guide with good references to get people started.
## Source and resources to replicate the machine. This includes materials and assembly steps.
- The first issue I see with sources is that specially in hardware there are different options that people want to consider when making their own versions. We need to deal with this scenarios where people can have different modules and variants. For instance there is a full
## Training program to replicate machine (option for newcomers)
## Community services
## For developers that want to extend, redesign and add new designs to the project
## Order a kit (We can source the kit)
- We don't have to fabricate anything, instead we can source the parts for the customer and ask for a fee. That should be cheaper. That would also depend on location, etc.
